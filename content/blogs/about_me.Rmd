##Introduction

My name is Atakan Erdogdu. I was born and raised in **Turkey**. I am an inquisitive individual who does not hesitate to ask why certain things evolve as they do. I remember wondering myself why do the numbers on the right-hand corner of the TV-screen changed on a daily basis, especially after someone important gave a speech or a major political event. I inquired my parents, consulted my classmates, and brought my questions to the classroom. Yet, I could not receive a satisfactory answer. Hence, I decided to find the answers myself and studied Finance at International Business School, where I earned a 4.0 GPA, and am currently studying at **London Business School**. 

During my undergraduate studies, I created the student-led BeHive Foundation with my fellow university students to research the effects of human factors on economic transactions and decision-making in general. Through our successful missions with NGOs, **BeHive** developed into a consultancy with global clients that range from N26, Magyar Telekom, and Groupama. Building something from the ground up, I was not only able to gain a composure in life at an early age, but also developed the ability to be resilient based on the background or the group I am in contact with. In addition to my experiences at BeHive, I worked at **Citi** as a Financial Analyst Intern and also had experiences in Turkey in both credit risk and corporate finance. I am currently looking to merge my passion for finance and economic transactions with my business and industry knowledge.

##Personal Interests & Hobbies

```

* Skiing: I have always loved competitive sports. Accordingly, as a previous competitive skier, my main hobby is skiing. I learned skiing when I was 5 years old and my passion for skiing never ended.

* Guitar: I have been playing classical for the past 8 years. I have always viewed music as something unique, something that does not need to be translated but speaks directly to the soul.

* Spearfishing: I am into adventurous sports. I like to spend my whole day with my brother in the sea, hunting fish and octopuses. My personal best is currently 3.1kg+ sea octopus.
