According to [Wikipedia's list of recession in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. Does the yield curve seem to flatten before these recessions? Can a yield curve flattening really mean a recession is coming in the US? Since 1999, when did short-term (3 months) yield more than longer term (10 years) debt?



Besides calculating the spread (10year - 3months), there are a few things we need to do to produce our final plot

1. Setup data for US recessions 
1. Superimpose recessions as the grey areas in our plot
1. Plot the spread between 30 years and 3 months as a blue/red ribbon, based on whether the spread is positive (blue) or negative(red)


- For the first, the code below creates a dataframe with all US recessions since 1946

```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE}

# get US recession dates after 1946 from Wikipedia 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States

recessions <- tibble(
  from = c("1948-11-01", "1953-07-01", "1957-08-01", "1960-04-01", "1969-12-01", "1973-11-01", "1980-01-01","1981-07-01", "1990-07-01", "2001-03-01", "2007-12-01","2020-02-01"),  
  to = c("1949-10-01", "1954-05-01", "1958-04-01", "1961-02-01", "1970-11-01", "1975-03-01", "1980-07-01", "1982-11-01", "1991-03-01", "2001-11-01", "2009-06-01", "2020-04-30") 
  )  %>% 
  mutate(From = ymd(from), 
         To=ymd(to),
         duration_days = To-From)


glimpse(recessions)
```

```{r yield curve last graph,fig.width=20, fig.height=10, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}

    plot.title = element_markdown(lineheight = 1.1),
    plot.subtitle=element_markdown(lineheight=1.1),
    legend.text = element_markdown(size = 11))

```


- To add the grey shaded areas corresponding to recessions, we use `geom_rect()`
- to colour the ribbons blue/red we must see whether the spread is positive or negative and then use `geom_ribbon()`. You should be familiar with this from last week's homework on the excess weekly/monthly rentals of Santander Bikes in London.



# Challenge 2: GDP components over time and among countries

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised


```{r read_GDP_data}
library(readxl)
UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(path=path.expand("data//Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

 The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by `1e9`, or $10^9$), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.


```{r reshape_GDP_data}

#Pivot longer for the years and the values
tidy_GDP_data  <-  pivot_longer(UN_GDP_data,!CountryID & !Country & !IndicatorName, names_to="year",values_to="value") %>% 
  #Convert to bn
  mutate(value=value/1e9)

glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)


# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")
```


```{r plot GDP 3 countries, fig.width=10, fig.height=10, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
tidy_GDP_data2 <- tidy_GDP_data %>% 
  filter(Country %in% country_list) %>% 
  filter(year>=1970) 

#The names are creating problems, first pivot wider, then change the names of the columns, and then pivot longer again
tidy_GDP_names <-pivot_wider(tidy_GDP_data2,names_from=IndicatorName,values_from=value) %>% 
  rename("Exports"="Exports of goods and services") %>% 
  rename("Imports"="Imports of goods and services") %>% 
  rename("Household expenditure"="Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)") %>% 
  rename("Government expenditure"="General government final consumption expenditure") 

#Change the data into its long version for plotting
long_GDP_names <- pivot_longer(tidy_GDP_names, !CountryID & !Country & !year,names_to="Components_of_GDP",values_to="values")

#GGplot uses factors as levels, change the factor order for the order in legend
long_GDP_names2 <- long_GDP_names %>% 
  filter(Components_of_GDP %in% c("Gross capital formation","Exports","Government expenditure","Household expenditure","Imports")) 
long_GDP_names2$Components_of_GDP<-factor(long_GDP_names2$Components_of_GDP,levels=c("Gross capital formation","Exports","Government expenditure","Household expenditure","Imports"))


long_GDP_names2 %>% 
  #Plot
  ggplot(aes(x=year))+
  geom_line(aes(y=values,group=Components_of_GDP,color=Components_of_GDP),size=1)+
  #For each country
  facet_wrap(~Country)+
  theme_bw()+
  #Reformat legend title
  scale_color_discrete("Components of GDP")+
  #Change x labels and add titles
  scale_x_discrete(breaks=c(1970,1980,1990,2000,2010))+
  labs(title="GDP components over time",subtitle="In constant 2010 USD",x="",y="Billion US$")
```

Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.

> What is the % difference between what you calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?

```{r plot GDP 3 countries_2, fig.width=20, fig.height=10, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}

perct_diff <- tidy_GDP_names %>% 
  rename("GDP"="Gross Domestic Product (GDP)") %>% 
  rename("G"="Government expenditure") %>% 
  rename("C"="Household expenditure") %>% 
  rename("I"="Gross capital formation") 
  #For each year and country, calculate the GDP and the difference

perct_diff2 <- perct_diff %>% 
  group_by(Country,year) %>% 
  summarize(GDP=GDP,GDP_calculated=C+I+G+Exports-Imports,difference=(GDP_calculated-GDP)/GDP)

perct_diff2 %>% 
  #For each the selected countries, summarize how far our GDP estimates are from the main estimates
  group_by(Country) %>% 
  summarize(avg_difference=(mean(difference)))
```

```{r gdp2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp2.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r plot GDP 3 countries_3, fig.width=15, fig.height=10, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
pro_GDP <- perct_diff %>% 
  #For each country & year
  group_by(Country,year) %>% 
  #Calculate components of gdp
  mutate("Government Expenditure"=G/GDP,"Gross capital formation"=I/GDP,"Household Expenditure"=C/GDP,"Net Exports"=(Exports-Imports)/GDP) %>% 
  select(Country,year,"Gross capital formation","Government Expenditure","Household Expenditure","Net Exports")

pro_GDP_long <- pivot_longer(pro_GDP,!Country & !year, names_to="categories",values_to="value")


pro_GDP_long %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=year))+
  geom_line(aes(y=value,group=categories,color=categories),size=1)+
  facet_wrap(~Country)+
  theme_bw()+
  #Remove legend title
  theme(legend.title=element_blank())+
  #Add percentage scales
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  #Use 10 year scaling in X
  scale_x_discrete(breaks=c(1970,1980,1990,2000,2010))+
  labs(title="GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars ",x="",y="proportion", caption="Source: United Nations, https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads")

```


> For each country, the weight of different components seem to be roughly close, which reveal the similarity in economic structures of these 3 countries. Roughly, Household Expenditure keeps accounting for the largest proportion over the decades, Gross capital formation goes next and then the Government Expenditure. And the net exports is always the smallest part. 

> However, there are varying trends for different components for different countries over the years. For example, the proportion of Household Expenditure in India keeps falling down for more than 10%, while that of Gross Capital formation has increased for more than 10%. The rest two parts, however, seem to be relatively stable. 

> As for Germany, proportions of Household Expenditure and Gross Capital formation keep falling. Weight of Government Expenditure didn't change much while Net Exports largely increased to nearly 10% almost from zero.

> And for United States, however, Household Expenditure on the contrary increased over decades although to a relatively small extent, while the proportion of Net exports stayed negative. And the biggest change would be that Gross Capital Formation surpassed Government Expenditure and became the second largest part.
