<p>##Introduction</p>
<p>My name is Atakan Erdogdu. I was born and raised in <strong>Turkey</strong>. I am an inquisitive individual who does not hesitate to ask why certain things evolve as they do. I remember wondering myself why do the numbers on the right-hand corner of the TV-screen changed on a daily basis, especially after someone important gave a speech or a major political event. I inquired my parents, consulted my classmates, and brought my questions to the classroom. Yet, I could not receive a satisfactory answer. Hence, I decided to find the answers myself and studied Finance at International Business School, where I earned a 4.0 GPA, and am currently studying at <strong>London Business School</strong>.</p>
<p>During my undergraduate studies, I created the student-led BeHive Foundation with my fellow university students to research the effects of human factors on economic transactions and decision-making in general. Through our successful missions with NGOs, <strong>BeHive</strong> developed into a consultancy with global clients that range from N26, Magyar Telekom, and Groupama. Building something from the ground up, I was not only able to gain a composure in life at an early age, but also developed the ability to be resilient based on the background or the group I am in contact with. In addition to my experiences at BeHive, I worked at <strong>Citi</strong> as a Financial Analyst Intern and also had experiences in Turkey in both credit risk and corporate finance. I am currently looking to merge my passion for finance and economic transactions with my business and industry knowledge.</p>
<p>##Personal Interests &amp; Hobbies</p>
<p><img src="/img/skiing.jpeg" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Skiing: I have always loved competitive sports. Accordingly, as a previous competitive skier, my main hobby is skiing. I learned skiing when I was 5 years old and my passion for skiing never ended.</p></li>
<li><p>Guitar: I have been playing classical for the past 8 years. I have always viewed music as something unique, something that does not need to be translated but speaks directly to the soul.</p></li>
<li><p>Spearfishing: I am into adventurous sports. I like to spend my whole day with my brother in the sea, hunting fish and octopuses. My personal best is currently 3.1kg+ sea octopus.</p></li>
